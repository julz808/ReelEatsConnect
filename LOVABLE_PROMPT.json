  "project_name": "ReelEats Creator Portal",
  "project_description": "A B2B marketplace platform connecting food content creators with restaurants, cafes, and bars for collaboration opportunities. This is separate from the main ReelEats B2C app.",

  "platform_context": {
    "what_is_reeleats": "ReelEats is a food discovery platform with two main products: (1) A B2C iOS app where users discover restaurants through short-form video content from food creators, and (2) This Creator Portal - a B2B marketplace that facilitates the collaborations that power the content on the B2C app.",

    "platform_purpose": "The Creator Portal is the engine that drives content creation for the ReelEats ecosystem. It connects food content creators (TikTok/Instagram influencers) with restaurants, cafes, and bars who want to be featured in their content. When matches are made through this platform, creators visit the venues, create content, and that content appears on the main ReelEats B2C app for consumers to discover.",

    "how_it_fits_in_the_architecture": {
      "existing_website": "The main ReelEats marketing website (reeleats.com) currently has two key sections: 'For Venues' and 'For Creators', explaining the value proposition for each audience.",

      "current_state": "Currently, both sections have an 'Apply to Join' button that links to a generic contact form. This creates friction and manual work.",

      "new_state_with_this_platform": "Once this Creator Portal is built, the 'Apply to Join' buttons should link directly to this new platform instead of the contact form. Specifically:",

      "integration_points": [
        "FOR CREATORS section 'Apply to Join' button → Link to Creator Portal signup page (/auth/signup/creator)",
        "FOR VENUES section 'Apply to Join' button → Link to Creator Portal signup page (/auth/signup/restaurant)",
        "Both sections can optionally also link to the Creator Portal landing page (/) which has its own CTAs to sign up"
      ],

      "user_journey": "Consumer uses ReelEats iOS app to discover food → Sees video from creator → Wants to become a creator themselves or is a venue owner who wants to be featured → Clicks 'Apply to Join' on main website → Lands on Creator Portal → Signs up → Creates profile → Browses and matches → Creates content → Content appears on B2C app. This completes the ecosystem loop."
    },

    "why_separate_platform": "This is a separate platform (not part of the iOS app or main marketing site) because: (1) It's a B2B marketplace with completely different functionality than the B2C discovery app, (2) Creators and venues need desktop-friendly tools for browsing profiles, managing connections, and communications, (3) It allows for independent scaling and feature development, (4) It connects to its own database tables in Supabase while sharing the same Supabase project as the main products.",

    "key_differentiators": "Unlike the iOS app which is consumer-facing and focused on restaurant discovery through video, this Creator Portal is B2B-focused, facilitating professional collaborations between two business entities (creators as businesses and venues as businesses). It needs to be clean, professional, and efficient - not flashy consumer app vibes."

Use the design system specified (coral #fd7158 primary color, Poppins + Inter fonts). Implement the simplified Express Interest matching system (NOT complex forms or inbox). Create all pages for both creator and restaurant user types. Connect to the existing Supabase project that's already configured in this Lovable project - do not create a new Supabase project. Make it clean, modern, and professional B2B marketplace aesthetic. Focus on the MVP features only. Start with the landing page, then authentication, then the dashboards, browse pages, connections pages, and profile pages. This platform completes the ecosystem loop: consumers discover → want to participate → sign up here → match and create content → content appears in B2C app."
